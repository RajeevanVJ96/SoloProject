## The Brief

The brief was to created a object oriented web application that covers all the core topics and utilises the various tools covered at the Academy in the last 6 weeks.

### Solution

My project was to create a website to allow a user to display their favourite pokemon in a team format. The application will allow users to add/remove their own pokemon to the team with various attributes. Each pokemon can also have its attributes edited.
